# Python-Statistics-Library
This is Statistics API using for Python

You can find the "CreateGraphProject" directory. The directory is a python project for using this Library.

This Library use matplotlib, numpy, math modules. (Alternatives/ProbabilityValueWithSympy.py use sympy, but not need)

This Library can draw graph for Statistics Distributions below.

1. DiscreteUniformDistribution (DU)
2. BinomialDistribution (B)
3. HypergeometricDistribution (H)
4. GeometricDistribution (G)
5. NegativeBinomialDistribution (NB)
6. PoissonDistribution (P)
7. ContinuousUniformDistribution (CU)
8. NormalDistribution (N)
9. ExponentialDistribution (E)
10. GammaDistribution (GAM)
11. chi_SquareDistribution (chi-Square)
12. t_Distribution (t)
13. F_Distribution (F)

Also, You can draw Cumulative Distributions and get probability P(a<X<b), confirm visually.

Preferences package is ready to Execute package, FunctionSHOW package is Examples how to use this Library.

GraphSave package is for saving image files.

Alternatives package can be ignored.

You can use the Library if you read the comments in python files.

## 2019.10.06 Update [Error Modification]

Savefile path is incorrect so the program didn't work.

The Error is fixed.
